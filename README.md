# JigitalclouN Database Study Case
JigitalclouN is an international server rental services provider that also sells the server hardware
used to host the servers. As a successful international company, JigitalclouN always manages to find
the most strategic yet economic locations all around the world to place their servers. Therefore, it
requires an efficient data management system to store and manage all its data, especially regarding the
server rental transactions which happen all the time and the server sales which occur a bit less often but
are still complicated to manage.
